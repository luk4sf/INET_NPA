The interface eno1 is using the fq_codel (Fair Queuing Controlled Delay) qdisc which combines Fair Queuing with the CoDel AQM scheme.
fq_codel groups packets into separate flows using stochastic models so that each flow receives a fair share of bandwidth, and CoDel controls latency by actively managing queue lengths. Within each flow, packets are kept in FIFO order to avoid reordering.
